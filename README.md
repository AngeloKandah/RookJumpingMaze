# RookJumpingMaze
This creates boards ranging from 5x5 to 10x10 for a rook jumping maze, in which a rook can only move as far as the number below on the tile allows. The rook must move in a cardinal direction.
The rook always starts in the top left corner and ends in the bottom right corner, however not every maze is solveable, but every move is a valid move.
This uses the hill descent algorithm to find local maximas to find the best solution final tile.
